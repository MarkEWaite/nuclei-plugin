    By default we recommended using the latest version of Nuclei.<br/>
    This option is offered to handle potential compatibility issues.<br/>
    In case of such issues:
    <ul>
        <li>please make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin.</li>
        <li>if the issue still persists choose an older version of Nuclei to maintain compatibility.</li>
        <li>notify the development team by creating an issue, so we can make the necessary changes.</li>
    </ul>
